# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I found a tutorial for a Job Dash using tailwind but i wanted to make it functional so i used all the tailwind the tutorial used and made the website on my machine and then added an API and functionality so you can retrieve the job information from clicking on the job card. It isnt responsive, its someone elses tailwind and its a bit hard to parse through but its a goal of mine to have the time to sift through and make it mobile friendly
